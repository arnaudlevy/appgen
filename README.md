# Appgen

Rails prototyping is fast, appgen intends to make it even faster!
Describe your app in a text file, then run appgen.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'appgen'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install appgen

## Usage

Run

    $ appgen

By default appgen will run the first text file in the current directory.
If you want to use a specific file, then do 

    $ appgen a_specific_file.txt

## Writing app descriptions

Here is the rails blog demonstration as appgen description:

    The app name is blogdemo.
    There are posts.
    A post has a title, a text (as text), a user, and comments.
    There are users.
    A user has a name.
    There are comments.
    A comment has a user.

### Hosting

And if you want to host it on heroku, just add:

    The app is hosted on heroku.

It will attempt to set the remote heroku host.
If the app does not exist, it will attempt to create it.

If the heroku app name is different from the app name, use:

    The app is hosted on heroku, by the name of blogdemo.

If you want the app to be created in Europe, use:

    The app is hosted on heroku in Europe.
